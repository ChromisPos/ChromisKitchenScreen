Welcome to the Chromis


Chromis Kitchescr was the first of a range of new products under the 
Chromis banner. The POS software needs to runnign on a database version
that supports multi connection, this means that it will not work with 
Derby embedded.

The Kitchen screen reads data from the pos softwares database,  and 
uses that data to populate the kicthen screen application. 

This was designed to work in conjunction ChromisPos. However, other 
POS applications can be made to work providing they are able to create
and populate the required table.


The initial screen displays 8 order panels and a list of any other 
orders in the system.
